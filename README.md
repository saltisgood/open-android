Open App Android
==============

Open App Android is an Android app that is designed to open up other apps. This is done primarily through Java type introspection and reflection.

App Download
==============
The app can be downloaded from the [Play Store here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nickstephen.openandroid).

Aims
==============
Open App Android's primary aim is to allow the user to view inside an Android app and check out some aspects of the code behind it. At the moment this is somewhat limited to just viewing the names of classes, methods, etc and their characteristics (i.e. modifiers, annotations) but soon reflection support will be added so that it can be executed and instantiated as well. This means you could for instance generate hashes from inside the authorisation class of an app as long as you could find it. 

There is also (currently) limited support for resource viewing of apps, such as strings, images and constants which will be expanded in the future.

Dependencies
==============
Open App Android has one dependency, [my Android library](https://github.com/saltisgood/salt-android-library) which is also hosted on GitHub. This in turn uses HoloEverywhere, but you can read about that on the other page.

Other Stuff
==============
Please check out the licence details for what you can and can't do with this source code. I'd encourage you to browse it and learn/ fix what you can but don't try to pass it off as your own work or release it yourself with a different key. You'd make me very sad :(

Contact me through GitHub for any questions about the app or how to use it.
